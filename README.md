# AdventOfCode

> [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Trying to make some clever solutions to them, hoping to have a low complexity solution that scales well with problem size. Not necessarily code-golfing the solutions, but I'll also be trying to keep the code small too. 

### Years

#### 2015
I haven't touched these since 2015, but I'll try and get back to updating these after I've done 2017.

The 2015 solutions look like I was going for more of a ... code-golf style. I'll try to complete and clean these up later.

#### 2016
I haven't touched these since 2016, but I'll try and get back to updating these after I've done 2017.

The 2016 solutions look more verbose. I'll try to complete these later.

#### 2017
Currently (Sept 2018) working on these. I think I've got a good thing going at the moment with these, up to day 9 so far.

Main goal is to not rely on any external packages, and implement some algorithms and data structures to solve the problems.
